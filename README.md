### Project Outline

Our PSAT project focused on designing and deploying a long-range tracking module integrated into a custom-built, aerodynamically optimized enclosure. The team engineered a tear-shaped capsule to minimize drag and maximize flight stability, enabling smoother trajectory and more reliable positioning during deployment.

A high-efficiency LoRa-based tracking system was embedded within the module, chosen for its low power consumption and exceptional range. This allowed us to track and retrieve the device in record time, outperforming expectations and demonstrating both the reliability of our tracking solution and the effectiveness of our aerodynamic design. My role in our team was in mechanical design and simulating the descent of the payload. This design was settled upon after adapting our original design specification to deploy minature payloads and track their scatter, however after OpenRocket Simulations, we decided that mission was not feasible. We could not determiine with enough certainty whether our minature payloads would land with an acceptable level of scatter from the rocket body outlined by the NZ Rocketry Association rules and regulations.
