  <strong>A custom go kart that was built as a personal project to learn practical mechanical skills</strong>

### Project Outline

The go kart features a custom chassis designed in Inventor and I welded it together using square hollow steel and flat plate steel for brake and throttle linkages, brake mountings, as well as high tensile rebar for the steering column.  

A chain tensioning engine mounting system was engineered to allow effortless engine movement, ensuring optimal chain tension. Throttle and brake linkages were custom built with available materials, and the steering column system was fine-tuned during testing.  

Powered by a 270cc water blaster engine, the kart combines the 40 series torque converter with an aggressive steering setup for a sharp and raw driving experience.
